            <h3>Serving Sushi</h3>
            <p>
                More raditionally, sushi is served on minimalist
                Japanese style, geometric, wood or lacquer plates which
                are mono- or duo-tone in color, in keeping with the 
                aesthetic qualities of the cuisine. 
            </p>
            <p>Many small Sushi restaurants actuall use no plates - the
                sushi is eaten directly off of the wooden counter, 
                usually with one's hands, despite the historical tradition
                of eating nigiri with chopsticks.
            </p>
